## What is Gophish?

Gophish is a phishing framework that makes the simulation of real-world phishing attacks dead-simple. The idea behind gophish is simple – make industry-grade phishing training available to everyone. “Available” in this case means two things –

* **Affordable** – Gophish is open-source software that is completely free for anyone to use.
* **Accessible** – Gophish is written in the Go programming language. This has the benefit that gophish releases are compiled binaries with no dependencies. In a nutshell, this makes installation as simple as "download and run"!
